### Data Storage & Information Retrieval :

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of Information Retrieval (IR), the process of obtaining relevant information from large collections of data, such as documents, multimedia, and databases. You will explore the foundational concepts of IR, including indexing, query processing, ranking algorithms, and evaluation metrics. The course also covers advanced topics such as web search, information filtering, recommendation systems, and natural language processing techniques applied to IR.

Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on projects to build and evaluate their own IR systems, gaining practical experience with tools and technologies commonly used in the field. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the skills necessary to design, implement, and assess IR systems, and to understand the challenges and opportunities in retrieving information in an era of big data.

Key Topics:

- Introduction to Information Retrieval
- Text Processing and Indexing
- Query Processing and Optimization
- Ranking Algorithms and Scoring
- Evaluation of IR Systems
